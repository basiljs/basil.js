# Roadmap  

Where is Basil.js heading? (This document should eventually be converted into milestones and issues)  

## 2.0.0

- [ ] ES6?  

## Possible new features

- [ ] HSL / HSB color mode  
- [ ] `size()` function for setting page size  
- [ ] set and get object properties easily  
- [ ] add to story  
- [ ] search for objects with certain properties (could be done with object search)  
- [ ] set reference point  

## Bugs
