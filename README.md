basil.js
========

:exclamation: NOTE :exclamation:

This is a development version of basil.js that uses a new syntax for all basil scripts, which will be introduced with the upcoming basil.js 2.0.

Basil.js scripts written for version 1.x will *not* work any longer with this branch. However, they can be easily rewritten to get them to work again. The main difference is that all basil commands now work without the `b.` prefix and that scripts are automatically run without using `b.go()` or `b.loop()`. Feel free to give this a try and make sure to let us know, if you find any bugs.

If you are looking for the last state of basil.js that still works with the `b.` prefix, you can find it in the [develop-v1](https://github.com/basiljs/basil.js/blob/develop-v1) branch.

Please note: Big general parts e.g. random() of the basil.js source code are copy & paste
of the fantasic [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) by the Processing.js team. We would have had a hard time to figure all of that out on our own!
