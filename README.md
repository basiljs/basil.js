Please note: Big general parts e.g. random() of the basil.js source code are copy & paste
of the fantasic [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) by the Processing.js team. We would have had a hard time to figure all of that out on our own!

Supported Adobe Indesign versions: CS 5, CS 5.5 and CS 6

If you want use Sublime Text instead of Adobe's Extendscript Toolkit, use the buildscript here: [extras/Sublime Text/](extras/Sublime Text/)
